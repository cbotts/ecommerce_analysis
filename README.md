## Methods
Multiple ARIMA models were built to capture various subsets of the data and hyperparameters were calculated with AutoARIMA. Train/test splits was made along the time axis to evaluate the quality of the models. 

## Conclusion 
Each of the models had a good fit for the data. Predicted sales values were flat with a very slight decline. These models do not appear to accurate predict very far into the future.
